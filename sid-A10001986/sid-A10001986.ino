/*
 * Build instructions (for Arduino IDE)
 * 
 * - Install the Arduino IDE
 *   https://www.arduino.cc/en/software
 *    
 * - This firmware requires the "ESP32-Arduino" framework. To install this framework, 
 *   in the Arduino IDE, go to "File" > "Preferences" and add the URL   
 *   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_index.json
 *   to "Additional Boards Manager URLs". The list is comma-separated.
 *   
 * - Go to "Tools" > "Board" > "Boards Manager", then search for "esp32", and install 
 *   the latest version by Espressif Systems.
 *   Detailed instructions for this step:
 *   https://docs.espressif.com/projects/arduino-esp32/en/latest/installing.html
 *   
 * - Go to "Tools" > "Board: ..." -> "ESP32 Arduino" and select your board model (the
 *   CircuitSetup original boards are "NodeMCU-32S")
 *   
 * - Connect your ESP32 board.
 *   Note that NodeMCU ESP32 boards come in two flavors that differ in which serial 
 *   communications chip is used: Either SLAB CP210x USB-to-UART or CH340. Installing
 *   a driver might be required.
 *   Mac: 
 *   For the SLAB CP210x (which is used by NodeMCU-boards distributed by CircuitSetup)
 *   installing a driver is required:
 *   https://www.silabs.com/developers/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers?tab=downloads
 *   The port ("Tools -> "Port") is named /dev/cu.SLAB_USBtoUART, and the maximum
 *   upload speed ("Tools" -> "Upload Speed") can be used.
 *   The CH340 is supported out-of-the-box since Mojave. The port is named 
 *   /dev/cu.usbserial-XXXX (XXXX being some random number), and the maximum upload 
 *   speed is 460800.
 *   Windows: No idea. Not been using Windows since 1999.
 *
 * - Install required libraries. In the Arduino IDE, go to "Tools" -> "Manage Libraries" 
 *   and install the following libraries:
 *   - WifiManager (tablatronix, tzapu) https://github.com/tzapu/WiFiManager
 *     (Tested with 2.0.13beta, 2.0.15-rc1, 2.0.16-rc2)
 *   - ArduinoJSON >= 6.19: https://arduinojson.org/v6/doc/installation/
 *
 * - Download the complete firmware source code:
 *   https://github.com/realA10001986/SID/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
 *   Extract this file somewhere. Enter the "sid-A10001986" folder and 
 *   double-click on "sid-A10001986.ino". This opens the firmware in the
 *   Arduino IDE.
 *
 * - Go to "Sketch" -> "Upload" to compile and upload the firmware to your ESP32 board.

 *  2023/08/28 (A10001986)
 *    - Fixes for Siddly, text output, i2c communication, and general.
 *    - Test code in SA.
 *  2023/08/27 (A10001986)
 *    - Adapt to TCD's WiFi name appendix option
 *    - Add "AP name appendix" setting; allows unique AP names when running multiple 
 *      SIDs in AP mode in close range. 7 characters, 0-9/a-z/A-Z/- only, will be 
 *      added to "SID-AP".
 *    - Add AP password: Allows to configure a WPA2 password for the SID's AP mode
 *      (empty or 8 characters, 0-9/a-z/A-Z/- only)
 *    - *123456OK not only clears static IP config (as before), but also clears AP mode 
 *      WiFi password.
 *  2023/08/25 (A10001986)
 *    - Remove "Wait for TCD WiFi" option - this is not required; if the TCD is acting
 *      access point, it is supposed to be in car mode, and a delay is not required.
 *      (Do not let the TCD search for a configured WiFi network and have the FC rely on 
 *      the TCD falling back to AP mode; this will take long and the FC might time-out 
 *      unless the FC has a couple of connection retrys and long timeouts configured! 
 *      Use car mode, or delete the TCD's configured WiFi network if you power up the
 *      TCD and FC at the same time.)
 *    - Some code cleanups
 *    - Restrict WiFi Retrys to 10 (like WiFiManager)
 *    - Add "Wait for fake power on" option; if set, FC only boots
 *      after it received a fake-power-on signal from the TCD
 *      (Needs "Follow fake power" option set)
 *    - Fix parm handling of FPO and NM in fc_wifi
 *  2023/08/20 (A10001986)
 *    - Fixes for siddisplay
 *  2023/08/14 (A10001986)
 *    - Add config option to disable the default IR control
 *  2023/08/01 (A10001986)
 *    - Fix/enhance ABORT_TT (BTTFN/MQTT) [like FC]
 *  2023/07/23 (A10001986)
 *    - First version of translator table according to current schematics
 *  2023/07/22 (A10001986)
 *    - BTTFN dev type
 *  2023/07/21 (A10001986)
 *    - Add LED translator skeleton, prepare display routines
 *  2023/07/09 (A10001986)
 *    - BTTFN: Add night mode and fake power support (both signalled from TCD)
 *  2023/07/07 (A10001986)
 *    - Add TCD notifications: New way of wirelessly connecting the props by WiFi (aptly named
 *      "BTTFN"), without MQTT. Needs IP address of TCD entered in CP. Either MQTT or BTTFN is 
 *      used; if the TCD is configured to use MQTT, it will not send notifications via BTTFN.
 *    - Add "screen saver": Deactivate all LEDs after a configurable number of minutes
 *      of inactivity. TT button press, IR control key, time travel deactivates screen
 *      saver. (If IR is locked, only '#' key will deactivate ss.)
 *  2023/07/03 (A10001986)
 *    - Save ir lock state (*71OK), make it persitent over reboots
 *    - IR input: Disable repeated-keys detection, this hinders proper game play
 *      Remotes that send repeated keys (when holding the button) are not usable.
 *  2023/06/29 (A10001986)
 *    - Add font and letter sequences
 *  2023/06/28 (A10001986)
 *    - Initial version: unfinished, entirely untested
 *      Missing: Display control; pin assignments; all sequences; etc.
